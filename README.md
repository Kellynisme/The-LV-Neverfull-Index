# Synopsis
The objective of this assignment is to look at the price difference of the LV Neverfull bag across different countries. We looked at how this price difference was affected by the importing distance of each country from the manufacturing location. Since the majority of the LV workshops for bag manufacturing are located in Europe, we chose Luxembourg as the origin location, from which these distances are measured, because Luxembourg is close to Central Europe'.

# The Creation of the Index

## 1. Importing data on Price
Our first step was importing the table that included the price of the LV Neverfull bag in 29 different countries. The imported data did not require cleaning.

## 2. Converting the price to CAD
The 'Price in USD$' column included the price converted from its local currency to USD for each of the 29 countries. We then converted the price from USD to CAD using the exchange rate of 1.35. The 'Price in CAD$' column contains the newly converted currency data.

## 3. Making a Bar Graph
We then constructed a bar graph displaying the CAD price of the Neverfull bag in each of the 29 countries.

## 4. Importing data on Distance
We imported another table that shows the external factor that we assume contributes to the global price difference - Distance. The 'Distance' column of the graph displays each country's distance from Luxembourg, our origin location around which the bags are manufactured.
